# Backend with Node Course
Hello, my name is Enrique, and I teach this React Native course as a summer course for EPN students. I hope you enjoy this introductory course focused on the Mobile development using node.

## Steps to Use the Example Projects:

1. Enter the corresponding project folder.
2. Ensure the folder contains the `package.json` file.
3. Run the command `npm i` or `npm install`.
4. Run the project command as usual, without any issues.
5. These steps work for all projects, whether they are React Native, Expo, or conventional Node.js projects.
